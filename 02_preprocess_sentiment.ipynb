    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on preparing text data for sentiment analysis through a series of essential cleaning and preprocessing steps. The following tasks are performed to ensure the text data is in a suitable format for analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Convert to Lowercase:</b> All text is converted to lowercase for uniformity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Remove URLs:</b> Any URLs present in the text are removed to avoid noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Remove Usernames:</b> Usernames starting with '@' are removed to protect privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Remove Hashtags:</b> Hashtags starting with '#' are removed to simplify the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Remove Non-Alphabetic Characters:</b> Non-alphabetic characters, such as special symbols, are removed to retain only meaningful words.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Lemmatize Words:</b> Words are lemmatized to their base form for better analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Remove One-Character Words:</b> Single-character words are removed to filter out irrelevant terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Remove Stopwords:</b> Common stopwords, such as \"the\" and \"is,\" are removed to reduce noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>Remove Duplicate Words:</b> Duplicate words are removed while preserving the order of words."

Angela Lansbury, (Eglantine Price) played an outstanding role as a woman who had taken a course in witch craft and was an apprentice who was beginning to fly on a broomstick and had quite a few difficulties taking off. Eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to make a bed travel to different parts of the world. However, Eglantine missed her final exams to becoming an accomplished witch. Mr. Emerlius Browne, (David Tomlinson) was the person who sold Eglantine this course in witchcraft and he tries to help her in every way possible to find her solution. Eglantine has a purpose to her madness and that is to stop the Nazi's from evading England. Great family entertainment and we need more films like this today.</td>\n",

       "20069    Never viewed this 1971 film and was greatly entertained by this great production created by the Walt Disney Studios and great animation creations. Angela Lansbury, (Eglantine Price) played an outstanding role as a woman who had taken a course in witch craft and was an apprentice who was beginning to fly on a broomstick and had quite a few difficulties taking off. Eglantine discovered many tricks and was able to make a bed travel to different parts of the world. However, Eglantine missed her final exams to becoming an accomplished witch. Mr. Emerlius Browne, (David Tomlinson) was the person who sold Eglantine this course in witchcraft and he tries to help her in every way possible to find her solution. Eglantine has a purpose to her madness and that is to stop the Nazi's from evading England. Great family entertainment and we need more films like this today.  \n",

    "# Sentiment Labeling with TextBlob Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we employ the TextBlob library for sentiment analysis on the preprocessed text data. By calculating polarity scores with get_sentiment(text), we assess sentiment intensity. The categorize_sentiment(score) function then assigns more nuanced sentiment labels such as \"Positive,\" \"Moderately Positive,\" \"Neutral,\" \"Moderately Negative,\" and \"Negative.\" This approach ensures a more accurate representation of sentiment, allowing for a finer-grained interpretation. By discerning between different degrees of positivity and negativity, we can gain more precise insights into the dataset's sentiment distribution and make informed decisions based on the nuanced sentiment labels."
